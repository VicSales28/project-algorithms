# Algorithms 💡

In this project, some algorithms were implemented. The concepts of Recursion and Sorting Algorithms learned during the first week of the Computer Science module were put into practice.

  <summary><strong>🎛 Linter</strong></summary><br />

To ensure code quality, we will use the Flake8 linter in this project. 
This way, the code will adhere to good development practices, making it more readable and easier to maintain! 
To run it locally in the project, execute the command below:

  ```bash
  python3 -m flake8
  ```

  <summary><strong>🧪 Running tests locally </strong></summary>

To run the tests, make sure that you have the virtual environment activated.

  <strong>🛠 Run tests</strong>

  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest
  ```
If you need to run just one test file, just run the command:

  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest tests/file_name.py
  ```

  <summary><strong>🐍 Python Version</strong></summary>
  
The Python version used in this project is 3.10.6. Don't worry: you can continue development with earlier versions, and everything should work correctly both locally and on the remote evaluator.

If you choose to use Python version 3.10.6 instead of earlier versions, you can take advantage of new language features while solving problems.

You can learn how to manage installed Python versions on your machine using pyenv. To use a specific Python version, you can use the command pyenv local 3.x.y to specify a version for a specific directory and pyenv global 3.x.y to specify the system-wide version.
